## Refridge

Reminds you when it is time to buy eggs again. 

The deal is, you put in a grocery item and specify a frequency of: daily, weekly, monthly, or once. Then it goes in the list. When you click it, it disappears until a day, a week, or a month later. This way it's always got your stuff you need, when you view the list.

If there's more than one person editing the list, changes will appear to everyone in real time. W00t!

### Evently CouchApp

The point of this app (aside from grocery lists) is an example of how to write a simple CouchApp. There will be [an online webcast in May](http://intranet.oreillynet.com/~andstone/webcasts/couchapp_webcast/couchapp-webcast_prg.html) that will teach you how to build this app, and you can expand those lessons to other apps.
